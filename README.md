## Overview

Revamp-it is a self-sustaining, mission-driven non-profit dedicated to sustainable IT. Our website serves multiple purposes:
- **Promote hardware recycling:** Accept and refurbish used hardware to prolong their lifecycle.
- **Foster community and education:** Provide workshops, Linux support, and open-source resources.
- **Facilitate direct engagement:** Inform users, support donors, and expand our digital presence.

This project is a complete redevelopment of our website with a modern tech stack and intuitive UX/UI—designed for performance, accessibility, and scalability.

## Vision and Objectives

- **User-Centric Design:** Create clear, accessible navigation that caters to diverse visitors (private, corporate, volunteers).
- **Modern Development Practices:** Use state-of-the-art open-source technologies to deliver a fast, secure, and SEO-friendly site.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Structure code for maintainability and ease of adding new features (blog, shop, events).
- **Sustainable Impact:** Reflect our mission of reducing e-waste and championing sustainable IT practices.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js**: Provides server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for SEO and performance.
- **React.js**: Leverages a component-based architecture for a dynamic user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for rapid, responsive UI design.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures robust, type-safe code.

### Backend & APIs
- **Node.js / Express.js**: For building high-performance RESTful APIs.
- **Headless CMS (Strapi / Sanity)**: To empower content creators with an easy-to-manage backend.
- **GraphQL (optional)**: For flexible data fetching where needed.

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Vercel / Netlify**: For seamless deployment and global Content Delivery Network (CDN) support.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistency across environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated testing and deployment (GitHub Actions).

### Other Tools
- **Algolia / Meilisearch**: Advanced search capabilities across content.
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Enforce code style and quality standards.
- **Jest & React Testing Library**: For frontend testing; Mocha/Chai for backend testing.

## Architecture Overview

The website is designed with a modular, microservices-friendly architecture:
- **Presentation Layer:** Next.js serves as the frontend framework that fetches data from APIs.
- **Content Layer:** A headless CMS powers content dynamically (blog posts, project pages, news).
- **API Layer:** Node.js/Express.js endpoints handle authentication, data processing, and third-party integrations.
- **Deployment:** The entire application is containerized using Docker for consistent, scalable, and secure deployments via Vercel's CD pipeline.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js (>=14) & npm/yarn**
- **Docker (for containerized development)**
- **Git**

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/revamp-it-modernization.git
   cd revamp-it-modernization
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**

   - Copy the environment template:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Edit `.env` with your API keys, environment variables, and configuration settings.

4. **Run Locally**

   Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The website will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Docker (Optional)**
   
   Build and run with Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Usage

- **Development**: Use hot reloading with Next.js for immediate feedback.
- **Testing**: Run tests with:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- **Building for Production**:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm start
  ```
- **Content Updates**: Manage your website's content via the headless CMS dashboard (URL provided in `.env`).

## Development Workflow

We follow a Git-based branching strategy:
- **Main Branch**: Always stable and production-ready.
- **Feature Branches**: Each new feature or bug fix should be developed in a dedicated branch.
- **Pull Requests**: Require code review and automated tests (via GitHub Actions) before merging.
- **Documentation**: Code should be well-commented and documented. Update the wiki and inline documentation as features are added.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to help develop this project:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add my new feature"`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/my-new-feature`
5. Open a pull request and describe your changes.

See our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details and our code of conduct.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Establish foundational project structure, integrate Next.js and headless CMS.
- **Phase 2**: Implement core pages (Home, About, Services, Blog, Contact) with responsive design.
- **Phase 3**: Enhance API integrations (search, authentication, third-party services).
- **Phase 4**: Optimize performance, accessibility, and add user personalization features.
- **Future Enhancements**: Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities, advanced analytics, and refined CI/CD workflows.
