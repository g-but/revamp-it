                We repair and refurbish IT devices of all ages, giving them a second life and reducing electronic waste. From 11-year-old MacBooks to vintage computers, we believe every device deserves a chance to continue serving its purpose. Our repair services help keep technology out of landfills and in the hands of those who need it.

                We're strong advocates for Linux and other open-source solutions. These technologies not only keep older devices running efficiently but also provide security advantages by giving users control over their systems. Our regular workshops help people learn how to use these powerful tools effectively.

              <p className="text-lg">
                We create meaningful employment opportunities for those who might struggle in traditional job markets. Our innovative barter system allows people to exchange services (like haircuts) for technology, making computing accessible to everyone. We also provide hosting and cloud services for Swiss SMEs who want to keep their data in Switzerland.

            <p>
              Founded in 2009, RevampIT started as a small repair shop with a big vision. What began as a simple idea - extending the life of technology - has grown into a movement that's changing how people think about their devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, our team of 20 dedicated individuals works together to promote sustainable IT practices. We've become a trusted resource for both individuals and businesses looking to reduce their environmental impact while maintaining access to reliable technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our commitment to sustainability goes beyond just repairing devices. We're actively involved in climate demonstrations, sharing knowledge about sustainable digital alternatives, and working to change the conversation around technology consumption.
